A Settings Controller is a service that encapsulates both the persistence and calculation of individual values. Each setting is represented by a distinct [key](setting-descriptor.md).

The Settings Controller returns a calculated value corresponding to a given key. A "calculated" value means that the actual value is computed based on the setting value derived from all participating sources.

```d2 scale="0.8"
client: Client

scm: Settings Controller Mediator {
  explanation: |md
  `SettingsController`
  |
}
firstSC: First Settings Controller {
  explanation: |md
  `ChainedSettingsController`
  |
}
secondSC: Second Settings Controller
nSC: Nth Settings Controller

xml: XML files {shape: document}
Database: {shape: stored_data}

custom: Custom Source {shape: stored_data}

client -> scm: getItem\nsetItem

scm -> firstSC

firstSC -> custom
firstSC -> secondSC: Delegate the request\nto the next controller

secondSC -> xml
secondSC -> Database

secondSC -> nSC
```

The extension order defines the sequence in which controllers are processed. 

The mediator selects the first controller,
and the processing order of the following controllers is determined by the implementation of this first controller.

## Use Cases

```d2
user: User {shape: person}
service: Service {shape: package}

settingsController: SettingsController {
  explanation: |kotlin
    suspend fun <T : Any> getItem(key: SettingDescriptor<T>): T?
    suspend fun <T : Any> setItem(key: SettingDescriptor<T>, value: T?)
  |
}

user -> service: Interacts
service -> settingsController

remoteDev: Remote Dev {
  clientAndHost: Client and Host
  processPerConnection: Process Per Connection

  clientAndHost -- _.settingsController: Sync settings both ways
  processPerConnection -- _.settingsController: Merge settings from local config dir and remote host settings
}

TBE -- settingsController: Enforce settings from a predefined profile
Cloud Env -- settingsController: Forbid some settings (e.g. keychain)
```

## Remote Dev

To ensure that a network request isn't performed for each setting,
a setting storage blob may initially be prepared and sent to the remote setting controller.
The default IJ Platform local setting controller is designed with that in mind.

### Process per Connection
Local Only.
We do not want to clone the configuration directory for each connection. The same configuration directory is reused for all clients.

## TBE

One important TBE requirement: unset value â€” set to some default value.

## Service

A service is an entity that implements specific IDE functionality. The Settings API, replacing the previous `PropertiesComponent`, can be used anywhere a suspend context is available.

Still the term `Service` is chosen specifically, advocating that ideally, all code should be implemented as a service.
