   * Starts a process on a remote machine. Right now, the child process may outlive the instance of IJent.
   * stdin, stdout and stderr of the process are always forwarded, if there are.
   *
   * Beware that processes with [ExecuteProcessArgs.pty] usually don't have stderr.
   * The [IjentChildProcess.stderr] must be an empty stream in such case.
   *
   * By default, environment is always inherited from the running IJent instance, which may be unwanted. [ExecuteProcessArgs.env] allows
   * to alter some environment variables, it doesn't clear the variables from the parent. When the process should be started in an
   * environment like in a terminal, the response of [fetchLoginShellEnvVariables] should be put into [ExecuteProcessArgs.env].
   *
   * All argument, all paths, should be valid for the remote machine. F.i., if the IDE runs on Windows, but IJent runs on Linux,
   * [ExecuteProcessArgs.workingDirectory] is the path on the Linux host. There's no automatic path mapping in this interface.
